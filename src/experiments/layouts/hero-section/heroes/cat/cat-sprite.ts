// Cat hero sprite sheet: 45 frames of a single left→right head turn, cut from a
// 24fps source clip with FFmpeg. The sub-range was chosen so the cat's gaze stays
// *up* across the whole turn (up-left → up-forward → up-right) — matching where a
// cursor over the nav or logo sits. Native frames only — interpolation softened
// the image and blending adjacent frames ghosted the ears mid-turn; 45 frames is
// enough that plain nearest-frame stepping isn't noticeable. Frames run
// monotonically left→right so cursor X maps straight onto the index. Each frame is
// 880×378 in a 9-column × 5-row grid (7920×1890), WebP q90 (~585 KB). See
// hero-section/README.md.
